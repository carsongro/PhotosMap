PhotosMap uses the user location so that whenever they take a photo using the app, it automatically adds that location to their map at the location that they took the photo. Tapping a photo also shows a list of photos with ~1 mile radus of where the tapped photo was taken. Users can also view their album of all of the photos they've every taken, and they can delete unwanted photos in numerous way!

PhotosMap saves data via JSON, and is primarily built around Core Location and MapKit! It also has additional optimizations to make sure that the map is smooth with many image annotations.
